  <h1> <strong> About me </strong> </h1>

  <p>I am an ambitious research scientist with proven track of relevant research experience based in Utrecht, the Netherland. Identifying innovative approaches and enhanced solutions to current challenges in cancer immunotherapy are research areas
    that drive and inspire me. Exploration, creativity, and motivation are my framework for success. I believe that fresh perspectives and applying new techniques such as single cell transcriptomics and novel gene editing platforms will offer a path
    to intercept, treat and cure complex diseases as cancer. My work is focused on producing quality research and making a significant impact. Iâ€™m happy to apply the experience and skills Iâ€™ve obtained in my career in order to manage projects through
    creative problem solving and innovative thinking.</p>
